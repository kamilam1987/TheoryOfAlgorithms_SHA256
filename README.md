# TheoryOfAlgorithms_SHA256

### Project Steps:

#### 30.01.2019 The first step regarding the project was to read the document under the title "SECURE HASH STANDARD" which is available under the link [1]. Then I decided to watch additional videos that helped me to understand more exactly what is SHA_256 [2], [3].

#### 09.02.2019  With the help of a video prepared by the lecturer, I was able to write a program that calculated 64 constants from SHA standards. First, I had to declare the first 64 primes numbers. Then, calculate the cube root of a prime numbers and  fractional part of a cube with 64 prime numbers. Next find the first 32 bits of decimal place of the number. Last part was to print this number in hexadecimal.[4]
